Shorten String

Prepbudy is having a string S of length N. The string only consists of characters 'A', 'B', and 'C'.
He can do the following operation on a string S zero or more times.

Choose i(1=i=|S|-1) such that Si?Si+1 replace Si with the character (among 'A','B' and 'C') that is different from both Si and Si+1 and remove Si+1 from S.

He wants to know the number of distinct strings that S can be after zero or more operations, and print the count modulo (109+7).

Input format:

The first line contains a single integer N - the length of the given string.
The second line contains S- the given string.

Output format:

Print the number of distinct strings that  S can be after zero or more operations, modulo  (109+7).

Constraints:

1=N=106

String S will only contains characters 'A','B' and 'C'.
